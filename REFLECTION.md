Here is the full study plan I got

Study Plan - Koen

- Review Array Methods (map, filter and find)
- Review React (focus on useState, useEffect and Routing)
- Complete the Amsterdam GP project (send it to one of the teacherâ€™s when done)
- Redo backend assessment
- Once you are comfortable with the above concepts, try the Redux practice

My strategy was to follow the above plan and spent the first week of the holiday on review array methods and functions and do the react practice. I realized quickly that I also lacked basic knowdledge and skills so I also revisited the boootcamp preparations block in the reader and kept on revisiting that that during the 2 weeks holiday. Simply practising with writing code myself. And understanding the key concepts.
In the second part of the first week I moved to react assessment. In the process I again noticed that I needed to do more practice on functions and methods and also needed to revisit week 1's server and client. Took the rest of my first week of the holiday doing more practice and also went through week 2 reader thoroughly and again whent trough week 3 and week 4 again. Especially, useEffect and useState I spent time on and also did more research on how react works.
In retrospect, what I see now is that I got behind on day 4 of the react week and that I didnt practice enough upfront with basic html, css and js. That was the reason that I failed week 2 assessment.
Same for backend week, I could follow pretty well during the week and I understand the concepts and succesfully did all reader assignments. The problem was basic skills around array methods, functions but also html and css. So also when repeating week 3 and week 4 reader I kept on revisiting that.
In the second week of the holiday I started the react GP project. That went relatively good initially but I noticed along the way that I needed to more practice. So I once again revisited functions and array methods, objects etc. Also, spent time on react hooks again because I noticed that there still was lacking skill. It was not so much the understanding anymore but more the skills of writing code myself. On Thursday an Friday I had contact with Swen. He looked at react GP assessment briefly and he advised me to do more practice with functions and array methods. Got a functions practice doc and spent two days on just wrting more functions, maps, filters, find and getting data from an array.
After those 2 weeks of practise I feel more comfortable with writing code. I feel I am ready now to move on with the practice assessment week 5. I now understand how a block of code executes and I feel comformatble with functions and methods. I practiced sufficentlky now with React and backend and also understand redux. The only thingh I couldnt do yet is repeat day 4 and 5 of week 4, thunks, the multipage app in redux and redux authentication. I need to revisit that in the coming two weeks. Will spent more time on that.
React I now have 49/60. Only have feature 7 and 8 not finalized but am close to getting it out. Will finalize tonight and then I think will get to 56/60 points then. I also didnt get the error message myself out on feature 4. So couldnt give myself full points there.
